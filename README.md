# React ToDo List

## Introduction

Quickly work through all major areas of the full stack so you can see it all come together:

- Client-side a.k.a. Frontend (React)
- Server-side a.k.a Backend (Express and some branches utilize a database: MySQL).

## Goal

After completing these practice drills, you should be able to quickly build and work in any ExpressJS application.

Building a basic CRUD app should be mostly muscle memory.

## Getting started

**How to perform this activity:**

As you attmpt to put this project together, take notes on things that don't immediately make sense to you. Create a CHEATSHEET to document these things and any steps that you think will be difficult to remember on your own. Don't attempt to start the server until you have built the server/server.js file. Once you have finished, you should delete everything and start over.

On the third rebuild: Do not reference code you already wrote. Instead, rely on DOCUMENTATION and your CHEATSHEET.

**Setup:**

- Navigate to the root directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm update`

USING MySQL:
- Make sure your MySQL server is running and be sure to change your login details in db/config.js
- To log into MySQL and seed your database: `npm run seed`
- Start webpack: `npm run dev-compile`
- Start your server: `npm run dev-server`

NO DATABASE:
- Start webpack: `npm run dev-compile`
- Start your server: `npm run dev-server`

**Note:**

If you run into WEBPACK or BABEL issues please get help. This activity is not designed for you to worry about that right now.
